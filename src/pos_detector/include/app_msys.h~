/** 
 * 	
 *	Code used for publishing a proper tf map by getting the information of the
 *	marker pose published by ar_pose. 	
 * 	
 * 	The global marker will be the parent of every other frame included 	
 *	both cameras. While both cameras will be the parents of the rest of the markers.
 * 	 	
 * 	The objective is to get the most updated information of the position of the robot 	
 *	by using any of the markers / cameras that are avaiable. 	
 *
 *	The global marker position will be saved as its position and the camera positions 	
 * 	will be static. To reduce the error a mean of the position will be performed after 	
 * 	measuring it several times.
