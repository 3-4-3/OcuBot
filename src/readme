How to start RocuBot by putting 2 streams on scene:

Start 2 devices and plug one kinect in each device

DEVICE 1
1st - roscore

DEVICE 2
2nd - open two terminal tabs and go to /Ocubot/src/roculus and in both do:
3rd - source ../../devel/setup.bash 						(to make sure we use the new version of roculus)
4th - export ROS_MASTER_URI of device n1 					(to make sure we connect to the other device)
5th - run in 1st terminal: roslaunch roculus kin1.launch 			(it will start streaming the 1st camera images)

CALIBRATION PART (will be added later / right now would work for 1 video stream)

DEVICE 1
6th- roslaunch pos_detector kin2.launch						(the 2nd camera will be on now and data will be publised in tf)

DEVICE 2
7th - run in 2nd terminal: rosrun roculus roculus_node 				(it will start the app)
